Link to original data source: UCI Machine Learning Repository: Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set


Dataset:- We are using a data set of hospital visits at 130 unique hospitals over the course of 10 years (1999-2008) in which diabetes was the diagnosis or cause for a hospital visit. The length of stay for these patients was at least one day and less than two weeks.

Research objectives:- Research objectives will include the following:
Correlation of hospital readmissions and which hospital was visited
Correlation between race, gender, and age and hospital readmissions
Correlation between race, gender, and age of diabetes diagnosis
What factors are the strongest predictors that a person will be readmitted in the future
Which hospitals are most effective in their treatment of diabetes patients
Correlation between any other common symptoms of diabetes diagnosis/patients.
